In this demo, we define two vector layers (`postgres` and `geojson`),
which have custom css classes attached to them
(see `/style.css` for their definitions).

The print template defines four quality levels:

    - dpi  0   = everything is printed as a screenshot
    - dpi  90  = rasters are printed as a screenshot, vector data as vectors
    - dpi 150  = everything is printed in medium resolution
    - dpi 300  = everything is printed in high resolution
